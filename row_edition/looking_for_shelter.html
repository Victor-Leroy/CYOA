    <h1>Jungle<br>Time Warp</h1>

    <div class="introduction-text">
        
As you stand in the laboratory, surrounded by the hum of machinery and the excited chatter of your fellow scientists, anticipation fills the air. Today is the day of the groundbreaking experiment—a leap through time itself. You watch as technicians adjust dials and calibrate instruments with precision, preparing for the momentous event.

But as the countdown reaches its climax, a sudden power surge rocks the laboratory, sending sparks flying and alarms blaring. In the chaos, you're engulfed by a blinding flash of light, and the next thing you know, you find yourself sprawled on the damp forest floor.

Disoriented and bewildered, you struggle to make sense of your surroundings. The towering trees loom overhead, their branches shrouded in mist. This isn't what was supposed to happen—you were meant to arrive in the desert, not a jungle lost in time.

As you pick yourself up and survey the unfamiliar terrain, you wake up in the jungle. You have no idea how you got here, but you know one thing for certain: you need to find a way back to the present. Your journey begins now.
